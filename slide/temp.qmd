## `Model`

`loss` and `forward`



## 3.2.3 前面

You may notice that `Module` is a subclass of `nn.Module`,
the base class of neural networks in `PyTorch`.
It provides convenient features to handle neural networks.
For example,
if we define a forward method,
such as `forward(self,X)`,
then for an instance a we can invoke this function by `a(X)`.
This works since it calls the forward method in the built-in `__call__` method.
You can find more details and examples about `nn.Module` in Section 6.1.
